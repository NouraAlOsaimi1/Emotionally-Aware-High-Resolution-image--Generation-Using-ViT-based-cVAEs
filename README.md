# Emotionally-Aware-High-Resolution-image--Generation-Using-ViT-based-cVAEs
In this project, we designed a hybrid generative model that combines the global attention capabilities of Vision Transformers (ViT) with the structured latent control of Conditional Variational Autoencoders (cVAE) to generate facial images that are not only realistic but also emotionally aligned. Developed by me & my team as part of our Advanced Artificial Intelligence course.
